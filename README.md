This is my attempt at a basic blockchain designed with JS and Angular, created alongside the SimplyExplained YouTube channel
================================================================================================================================================================================
THE FOLLOWING IS DESCRIPTION TAKEN FROM THE Savjee/savjeecoin-frontend REPOSITORY IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AS I AM LEARNING HOW TO DO THIS
THROUGH PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND THE GUIDANCE OF A YOUTUBE VIDEO. HENCE I DON'T CLAIM TO HAVE SOLELY CREATED ANY OF THE CODE IN THIS REPOSITORY AS IT WAS CREATED WITH THE AID
OF A CODING GUIDE PLAYLIST. FOLLOW THE LINK TO GIVE IT A SHOT: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzvRQMJ9HDiTqZmbtFisdXFxul5k0F-Q4
================================================================================================================================================================================
Angular application that allows you to interact with a blockchain. You can see the blocks on chain, see transaction within them and even create new transactions and mine blocks.

Built on top of DragonCoin (a simple Blockchain implementation in Javascript).
